# DataScience
This repository is mainly contains projects on Python created during learning DataScience course and mostly dedicated to solving real business tasks via Data Preprocessing, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis.

# Bank Clients Churn Prediction
Bank's clients start to leak every month. Not so much, but significantly. Market analysts found out that to save actual customers is cheaper than bring new ones. In this project we'll builld model to predict whether client is going to leave or not. In our possesion information about clients, their behavior and services they use. To evaluate model performance we'll use f1 score and set it's treshold on 0.59. Additionaly we will calculate AUC-ROC metric. Then compare both.

During this project we'll have to handle classes imbalance in few ways. So we can compare their efficiency and found out wich one is most fittable in this case. Also we'll see which of features have most importance on prediction. 

# Borrowers Credibility Analisys
Bank wants to know which factors have influence on it's borrowers payability. To do this we are going to draw typical portraits of most and least solid loanees. Find out if family status or number of children are might be a cause of payments failures. And how does loan purpose impact on payment delays. On input we have statistical data about customers credibility. Exploration results will be used in building credit scoring model. Also we a going to explore the most important features.

# Car Price Prediction
Dataset contains technical characteristics, complectation and prices of cars. The goal is to learn model for prediction car prices. In this project we built three models to predict car prices. Two of them are gradient boosting algorytms, well-known for their own categorical encoders. Lets see how it works out!

# Clients Churn Prediction
Telecom operator wants to predict a possible leak of it's clients. Company will offer some special benefits to those of them who's going to leave. Operator's team has collected personal data about their clients. So we need to build model that is able to predict their loss. 

Also we'll find time after that probability of loosing client increases significantly.

And in additional part we will draw the portreit of client who's going to get out.

# Clients Personal Data Protection
An insurance company needs to protect its clients personality. We should porpouse a method to hide customers identity. But metrics of machine learning models have to be the same.

# Computer Games Sellings Analysis

In this project we need to predict the best selling computer games for the next year. To do that we going to analyze statistics of previous years (before 2017) - sales, critic and user scores, genres, platforms, etc.

We'll draw typical portreits of American, European and Japanees gamers, determine the most popular and the most profitable genres, and find out if users and critics feedbacks influent on sellings. 

# Customer Age Assessment
A grocery store deploys computer vision system for customer photo analysis. So our goal is to learn a model to assess an age of buyers. It'll help company to control alcohol sellings and recommend to customers other items depends on their age group

# Gold recovery
In this project we going to build model to predict percentage of gold recovery from feed. During exploration we'll find out if machine learning model could help to improve gold extraction process, make it more efficiently.

# Interactive Air Quality Monitoring Map
This project is dedicated to creating interactive air-quality monitoring map of Moscow. So citizens could freely gain possesion of actual and truthful information about air-quality condition at any time. The mean goal of this work is to build model able to predict air pollutants concentrations for the next day. As an input data we have concentration of CO, N, NO2, PM10, PM25 for previous periods, parameters of weather condition. The whole project is made up of four parts: Data Engineering, Model Tuning, Machine Learning, Map Creating. Description of each of them is down below.

# Mobile Phone Tariff Recommendation
In our possesion information about mobile operator clients that use "Ultra" and "Smart" tariffs. We need to build model to recommend to customers optimal for them tariff. Model Accuracy has to be not less than 0.75.

In this project we've built DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression models to give tariff recomendation to mobile operator customers.

# Mobile Phone Tariffs Analisys
Mobile phone operator offers to it's clients two tariifs: "Smart" and "Ultra". First one is cheaper, but includes not so much services. Second one contains almost all what costumer needs but it's distinctly expensive. To build commercial budget marketing department needs to find out which of them is more profitable.

In this project we'll draw typical porteits of users of both tariffs and test some hypothesis.

# NLP Telegram bot
In purpose to help DS students to learn more about NLP and have some fun I developed thematic Telegram chat bot. It answers questions about modern methods of word vectorization such as BERT and GPT3.

# Gym Mountain Car via TensorFlow
Here is the one-dimensional game from OpenAi Gym which goal is get the car on the mountain tip https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/ The car is not powerful enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. So we need to drive it back and forth to build up momentum. To solve this task we going to build a simple neural network with TensorFlow.

# Real Estate Price Analisys
In our possesion are real estate ads from St. Petersburg and neighborhoods for few years. In this project we are going to analyze building markets and determine an average price. It'll help to detect anomalies and scams.
Also we'll find out what the most important factors of price are and differences between properties in city center and other locations.

# Sentiment analysis with TF-IDF & BERT
Online store starts new service allows users to edit and add item's description like it does in wiki community. It need to be developed the tool to find toxic comments and send them to moderation. Our goal is to build model that predicts whethere comment toxic or not. We're going to use Logistic Regression as a model and two methods to vectorize features - TF-IDF and BERT. Let's see which one will show better results! <br />
Also we implement fine-tuning BERT models. And it appears that their perfomances exceed are expectations! 

# Taxi Orders Prediction
We have a taxi orders data for few months of 2018. In porpouse to avoid drivers shortage we need to learn model to predict amount of orders in the next hour. Root mean squared error of prediction should be less then 48. We use linear regression and gradient boosting alghorytms. Time series has a trend and daily seasonality. Lets see how our models are going to handle this task!

# The Most Profitablle Oil Region
This project is dedicated to oil industry. We need to find a location for drilling new boreholes. In our possesion oil samples from the three regions. Quality of oil and value of reservoirs were measured in 10 000 borehols in each of them. We need to build a model to find out wich region will bring the most profit, make profitability and risk assesment via bootstrap technique.
