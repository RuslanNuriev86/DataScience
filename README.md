# DataScience
This repository is mainly contains projects on Python created during learning DataScience course and mostly dedicated to solving real business tasks via Data Preprocessing, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis.

## Project 1
### Car Price Prediction
Dataset contains technical characteristics, complectation and prices of cars. The goal is to learn model for prediction car prices. In this project we built three models to predict car prices. Two of them are gradient boosting algorytms, well-known for their own categorical encoders. Lets see how it works out!


## Project 2
### Taxi Orders Prediction
We have a taxi orders data for few monthes of 2018. In porpouse to avoid drivers shortage we need to learn model to predict amount of orders in the next hour. Root mean squared error of prediction should be less then 48. We use linear regression and gradient boosting alghorytms. Time series has a trend and daily seasonality. Lets see how our models are going to handle this task!
