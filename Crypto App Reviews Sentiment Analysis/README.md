In this project we analyze user reviews of 10 of the most popular crypto related mobile apps (Google play store in this case). We provide some sentiment analysis. Check correlation between scores and sentiments of user reviews. And figure out which feelings prevails (and give some thought about what that means). At the end I left a summary of the project.
