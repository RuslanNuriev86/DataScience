# Gold recovery

In this project we going to build model to predict percentage of gold recovery from feed.

Thecnological process has two main stages:
- flotation (process for selectively separating of hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic). At this stage rougher feed brings to the tank with a liquid. On issue it has refractory ore for further gold recovery treatment and tails.
- primary and secondary cleaning. After this procedure we have final gold particles and new tails.

During exploration we'll find out if machine learning model could help to improve gold extraction process, make it more efficiently.
