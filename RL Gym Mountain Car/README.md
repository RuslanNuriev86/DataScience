Here is the one-dimensional game from OpenAi Gym which goal is get the car on the mountain tip https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/ The car is not powerful enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. So we need to drive it back and forth to build up momentum. To solve this task we going to build a simple neural network with TensorFlow.

### Models
- Sequential Neural Network From TnsorFlow

### Usage
First of all you should install tensorflow, gym, keras, keras-rl2, pygame, imageio-ffmpeg

```
!pip install tensorflow-cpu
!pip install gym
!pip install keras
!pip install keras-rl2
!pip install pygame
!pip install imageio-ffmpeg
```

### Requirements
